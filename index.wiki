= a way of learning mandarin chinese =

This blog's purpose is to commit to and keep a trace of my progression in the journey to learn how to speak mandarin chinese, as well as how to read and write simplified chinese.

All ideas here are inspired from other people's methods and their returns on experience, making a mixture of them.

The framework used for writing and maintaining this 'blog' is [[https://vimwiki.github.io/|vimwiki]], 
Which is a Vim plugin that helps writing markdown-style syntax, and ships with a "mardkown to html" engine. It is simple. You should give it try.

Have a look on my feedback page on how to learn chinese efficiently [[vocabularylists.wiki|here]].
